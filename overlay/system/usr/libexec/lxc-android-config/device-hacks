# This is device-hacks, a placeholder file for device-specific "hacks" or commands
# that has to be run on the GNU/Linux side at boot.


# To use, overlay a shell script to this file. By default, it'll run after
# lxc-android-config.service (the container), but one can override the behavior
# by overlaying device-hacks.service.d/device-specific-settings.conf or the
# device-hacks.service file itself.
